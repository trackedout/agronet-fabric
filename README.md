# AgroNet Fabric

A Fabric mod that serves as proxy between in-game Decked Out events and [dunga-dunga](https://github.com/trackedout/dunga-dunga-backend), the backend API.

This runs on the [Tracked Out](https://trackedout.org) network.

### Usage

Start a local Minecraft server on port 25575. You may have to edit ./run/eula.txt and set `eula=true` when running this for the first time.

```bash
./gradlew runServer
```
